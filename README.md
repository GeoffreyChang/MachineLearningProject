# TEEP Machine Learning Project

### Background Information
I was given 13 datasets, each having 15 variables. The dataset came from a thermal elongation machine, which from my understanding, is a spindle that spins a metal rod very fast; due to this speed, heat is produced, and the metal rod elongates. 
Whereas the variables consist of the following:
Time (time at which the data was taken)
RPM (The speed at which the spindle is spinning)
T1-T12 (Various temperature points of the machine)
Z (the displacement of the rod in the z-axis)

The assigned task required me to apply my extensive knowledge and predict the amount of displacement the rod experiences in the z-axis based on the temperature data. To do this, I have applied many machine-learning models. Where some of which did not work better than others. In this report, I will discuss the models I have applied.
